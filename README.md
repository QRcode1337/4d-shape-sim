## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.dev](https://v0.dev).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.dev](https://v0.dev).

## Deployment

Your project is live at:

**[https://vercel.com/qrcode1337s-projects/v0-next-js-4d-shape-simulator](https://vercel.com/qrcode1337s-projects/v0-next-js-4d-shape-simulator)**

## Build your app

Continue building your app on:

## Visual Interference Patterns

The viewer now shades edges and vertices with dynamic colors generated from
their positions. Sinusoidal interference creates subtle gradients across each
shape, adding depth and variety to the visualization.

## Filled Faces

Each shape now includes semi-transparent surfaces to better convey volume.
Dynamic vertex colors give these faces gentle interference patterns similar to
the edges and points.

## Offline Fonts

The application no longer pulls Google fonts at build time. It falls back to
your system's default sans-serif stack, preventing blocked font requests during
deployment.

## How It Works

1. Create and modify your project using [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)
2. Deploy your chats from the v0 interface
3. Changes are automatically pushed to this repository
4. Vercel deploys the latest version from this repository
